# Want3-ETHHK

Want3 is a public goods tool dedicated to addressing the 'meeting someone's wish' needs. Our platform allows anyone to post their wishes and share them with others, encouraging participation in fulfilling these desires. The applications for our tool are manifold, including crowdfunding for birthday gifts, where you can send a wish list to your friends to help you make the purchase.

In addition to developing a tool for payments, we are heavily invested in the fan economy track, committed to assisting Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in completing their gift lists. This process serves as a form of tipping for streamers, akin to a reverse Friend.Tech mechanism. KOLs can distribute their gift lists to followers, and if these wishes are met, the followers may receive certain privileges from the KOLs, such as inclusion in group chats or opportunities for in-person interactions.

Currently, we are solely a payment tool, but our future development direction encompasses becoming a live streaming platform, emulating platforms like OnlyFans and Friend.Tech.
